<h1>Features</h1>
This site allows users to play a traditional game of Tic Tac Toe, the application is still a work in progress as it is only useable on Desktop/Laptop devices,  responsiveness for mobile is in progress 

Aside from the use of both Flexbox and Grid, the application showcases the uses of factory functions and Module functions, this application has only a few lines of global js.

About
